i've been on a roll, where you've been?
real protective with my soul, where you've been?
is your GPS even on, where you've been?
matter of fact, i don't even care where you've been
bad vibes, get off of me
outta here with that fuckery
treat my goals like property
collect them like Monopoly
i probably won't come if there's not a fee
and if they try come stoppin' me
i show them my REPOSITORIES HOEEEE
